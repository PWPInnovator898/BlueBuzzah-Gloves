First and foremost, this project draws significant inspiration from the coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation research led by Dr. Peter Tass of Stanford and colleagues.

The Blue Buzzah Gloves project was successfully designed, prototyped and tested by a widely distributed collection of dedicated "citizen researchers", comprised of people directly or indirectly affected by Parkinson's.

Motivated soley by the opportunity to potentially help people with Parrkinson's, none of the collaborators has any commercial interest in this work.
