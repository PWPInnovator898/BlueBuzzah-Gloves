The Blue Buzzah Gloves project was successfully designed, prototyped and tested by a widely distributed collection of dedicated "citizen researchers", comprised of people directly or indirectly affected by Parkinson's.
Motivated soley by the opportunity to help people with Parrkinson's, none of the collaborators has any commercial interest in this work.
