05-06-25: Added a note to our 3D print .STL file indicating that the lids for the Blue Buzzah tactors and enclosures rely on a precise friction fit that was 
designed using a Bambu P1S printer with ABS filament.  Using a different type of printer and/or filament may result in enclosure lids and tactor caps that ending 
up being too tight or too loose.  The Etsy vendor listed in our parts list has verified proper fit of a test print of our STL using his Bambu X1C printer.
