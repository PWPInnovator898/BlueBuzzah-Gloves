# BlueBuzzah Gloves

The BlueBuzzah Gloves system is an open-source, non-invasive neuromodulation platform inspired by the groundbreaking coordinated reset (CR) therapy research led by Dr. Peter Tass and others.

## About the Project

The BlueBuzzah Gloves project was developed by an informal group of "citizen research" collaborators ("BlueBuzzah Partners") focused on advancing access to open-source DIY tools for people with Parkinson's.

## Features
- Wireless Bluetooth BLE-synchronized vibrotactile stimulation
- Flexible, customize-able coordinated reset pattern and simulation generation
- Highly precise  left <--> right glove synchronization
- 8+ hours operation on a single charge
- Built with:
  - Adafruit hardware @ https://www.adafruit.com/
  - Adafruit CircuitPython libraries @ https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython
