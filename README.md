# BlueBuzzah Gloves

The BlueBuzzah Gloves system is an open-source, non-invasive neuromodulation platform inspired by the coordinated reset (CR) therapy research of Dr. Peter Tass and others.


## About the Project

The BlueBuzzah Gloves project was developed by an informal group of collaborators ("BlueBuzzah Partners") focused on advancing open-source neuromodulation tools.
